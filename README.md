# 🔥 California Wildfire Impact Analysis Dashboard

This project explores the devastating effects of wildfires across California from 2014 to 2024 using interactive data visualizations built in Tableau. It integrates structural damage, air quality (CO AQI), financial losses, weather trends, and building type vulnerability to uncover insights that support emergency planning and environmental policy.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Identify counties with the highest wildfire-related damage and air pollution.
- Analyze trends in fire frequency, structural loss, and pollution over time.
- Examine how temperature and precipitation influence wildfire risk.
- Determine which building types are most vulnerable to fire damage.
- Compare structural and atmospheric impacts across regions.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **California Wildfire Damage Dataset**
   - Damage Score (0–4 scale)
   - Structure Type
   - County, Latitude, Longitude
   - Property Loss & Fatalities

2. **California Weather Dataset**
   - Average Precipitation
   - Max Temperature
   - Year

3. **U.S. Pollution Data (2000–2024)**
   - CO AQI (Carbon Monoxide Air Quality Index)
   - Pollution Dates & Counties

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Map of Structural Damage Across Counties**
- **CAL FIRE Unit Impact & Severity Map**
- **Wildfire Impact on Homes, Businesses, Vehicles (2014–2023)**
- **Bar Chart of Financial Loss by County**
- **Fatalities & Injuries by Fire Cause**

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Structural damage peaked in 2018; pollution peaked in 2019.
- August is the worst fire month for CO AQI.
- Agricultural buildings and mobile homes are the most vulnerable.
- Some counties experience high pollution despite lower damage, indicating regional smoke dispersion.
